Stock Market Trend Prediction
A comprehensive machine learning project for predicting stock market trends using technical indicators, classification models, and time-series forecasting techniques.
📊 Project Objective
This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models that can:

Classify trend direction (up/down) for short-term trading decisions
Forecast stock prices using historical patterns and technical indicators
Analyse market volatility and risk characteristics
Provide actionable insights through interactive dashboards

🔬 Methodology Overview
Data Sources

Yahoo Finance API via yfinance for historical stock data
Technical indicators calculated from OHLCV data
Market sentiment indicators (optional extension)

Feature Engineering

Simple Moving Averages (SMA): 5, 10, 20, 50-day periods
Exponential Moving Averages (EMA): 12, 26-day periods
Relative Strength Index (RSI): 14-day momentum oscillator
MACD: Moving Average Convergence Divergence signals
Bollinger Bands: Volatility-based trading bands
Returns: Daily, weekly, and monthly percentage changes
Volatility: Rolling standard deviation measures

Machine Learning Models
Classification (Trend Direction)

Logistic Regression: Baseline linear classifier
Random Forest: Ensemble method for non-linear patterns
XGBoost: Gradient boosting for superior performance

Forecasting (Price Prediction)

ARIMA: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
Prophet: Facebook's time-series forecasting tool
LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (optional)

Evaluation Strategy

Time-series aware validation: Walk-forward analysis to prevent data leakage
Classification metrics: Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, F1-score, Precision/Recall
Forecasting metrics: RMSE, MAE compared against naïve baseline
Financial metrics: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown analysis

🚀 Getting Started
Installation

Clone the repository
bashgit clone <repository-url>
cd stock_market_prediction

Create virtual environment
bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies
bashpip install -r requirements.txt


Quick Start Workflow

Data Collection: Run notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb to download and explore stock data
Feature Engineering: Execute notebooks/02_feature_engineering.ipynb to create technical indicators
Model Development: Use notebooks/03_model_development.ipynb for training and validation
Results Analysis: Review performance in notebooks/04_results_analysis.ipynb
Dashboard: Launch interactive visualisation with python app/dashboard.py

📈 Usage Examples
Loading Stock Data
pythonfrom src.data.data_loader import StockDataLoader

loader = StockDataLoader()
data = loader.get_stock_data("AAPL", period="2y")
Engineering Technical Indicators
pythonfrom src.features.technical_indicators import TechnicalIndicators

indicators = TechnicalIndicators()
enhanced_data = indicators.add_all_indicators(data)
Training Classification Model
pythonfrom src.models.classification import TrendClassifier

classifier = TrendClassifier(model_type='xgboost')
classifier.train(X_train, y_train)
predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)
🔍 Key Features

Modular Design: Separate modules for data, features, models, and visualisation
Robust Testing: Pytest framework with data validation tests
Interactive Dashboard: Plotly/Dash web application for results exploration
Time-Series Validation: Proper temporal splitting to avoid lookahead bias
Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed docstrings and inline comments
Financial Focus: Emphasis on practical trading applications

⚠️ Important Limitations

Market Complexity: Financial markets are influenced by countless factors beyond technical indicators
Model Overfitting: Historical patterns may not predict future performance
Transaction Costs: Real trading involves fees, slippage, and liquidity constraints
Regulatory Compliance: This is research code, not licenced financial advice
Data Quality: Results depend heavily on clean, accurate historical data

🧪 Testing
Run the test suite to validate data processing and model functionality:
bashpytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/ --cov=src  # With coverage report
📊 Dashboard
Launch the interactive dashboard for exploring results:
bashpython app/dashboard.py
Navigate to http://localhost:8050 to view:

Historical price charts with technical indicators
Model prediction visualisations
Performance metric comparisons
Risk analysis plots
